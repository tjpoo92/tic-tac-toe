# TIC-TAC-TOE

---

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a tic-tac-toe game while focusing on scope and closure

The main goals were to:

- Use modules and factory functions
- Allow players to input their names and use their names in the winner announcement
- Check for winner and ties
- Button to start/restart game
- Don't allow player to use already marked square

In addition to the main goals, to challenge myself I also added the following:

- Allowing the players to select their game piece and automatically change the other player's piece
  - Using a slider UI

### Abilities Demonstrated

- Using the reveal module pattern
- Using factory functions
- Properly using scope
- Properly using closure
- Basic algorithm skills
- JS Array Manipulation

## Overview

The project was very enjoyable. My biggest obstacle was time and one scope issue I could figure out between to function and needed to inquire on. However, other than that the project actually went very quick and I spent most of my time reminding myself what I was trying to do and focus on. Once I was caught up thought I was able to knock out the logic extremely quickly.

### Items I'd like to improve on for future projects:

- Would like ensure I stay focused better
  - Got distracted multiple times which required me to learn the topic I was trying to focus on
  - Some of this feels unavoidable, but I feel like if I make a plan and stick to it I should be able to meet this better.
- Outlining projects and pseduocode
  - I honestly think this was what made this project so easy. This was my first time dedicating a good portion of time to just doing those two things and even though there was a lot of time between outlining and writing the pseduocode when I got back to working on the project I knocked out extremely quickly.
